To find the parameters for a planet we recommend you use the [Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/) where `t0` is the time of conjunction (`tc` on the Exoplanet archive), `p` is the orbital period in days, `rp_rstar` is the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius, `a_rstar` is the ratio of the planet's semi-major axis to the star's radius, `inc` is the inclination of the planet (in degrees), `ecc` is the eccentricity of the planet (0 inclusive to 1 exclusive), and `w` is the agument of periastron of the planet (in degrees).

Orbital parameters are given as a list. The first value is the absolute measurement. The second value (if provided) is the symmetrical error on the measurement; eg, \[1, 0.1\] = 1 +/- 0.1. The third value (if provided) is the upper error on the measurement, with the second value now taken as the lower error; eg, \[1, 0.1, 0.2\] = 1 (+ 0.1/- 0.2).
